See ChangeLog.txt for the complete history of changes to BC2.


4. Distributing BC2 on a Network
--------------------------------
Follow these steps to distribute a registered Beyond Compare to users on your
network:

- Place a copy of the BC2 setup program (ie beycomp.exe) on your network.

- Create a text file in the same location, paste your license key in it, and
  save it as "BC2.key".  Also, copy any plug-ins (*.bcp) that you want users
  to have into this same folder.

- When a user runs the setup program from this location, it will automatically
  copy the license key file to their system and BC will be registered.

If you like, have users run the setup program with the switch "/silent". There
will be a single confirmation and then Beyond Compare will install without
further interaction.
